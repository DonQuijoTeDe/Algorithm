A string is k pallindrome if it can be transformed into a palindrome on removing
at most k characters from it. Your task is to complete the function is_k_pallin
which takes two arguments a string str and a number N . Your function should
return true if the string is k pallindrome else it should return false.

Input:
The first line of input is an integer T denoting the number of test cases .
Then T test cases follow . Each test case  contains a string str and an integer
N separated by space.

Output:
The output will be 1 if the string is  k pallindrome else 0 .

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=length of str<=100
1<=N<=20
