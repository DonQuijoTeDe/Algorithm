Given a value V, if we want to make change for V cents, and we have infinite
supply of each of C = { C1, C2, .. , Cm} valued coins, what is the minimum number
of coins to make the change?

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case is V and N, V is the value of cents and N is the
number of coins. The second line of each test case contains N input C[i],value
of available coins.

Output:
Print the minimum number of coins to make the change, if not possible print -1.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ V ≤ 10000
1 ≤ N ≤ 50
1 ≤ C[i] ≤ 100

Example:
Input
1
7 2
2 1

Output
4
